      <h2>Why “Maama Ani Pilusta”?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>"Maama Ani Pilusta"</strong> means <em>"Emi ani pilavanu? Umm maama ani pilusta, neeku okay na?"</em> — a simple question filled with love, care, and emotion.
        This website is built on that same feeling: checking in, listening deeply, and reminding each other that we are not alone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>My Emotions & Life Situations</h2>
      <p>
        Life is not always strong smiles and loud success. Sometimes it is silent pain, unanswered questions,
        broken expectations, and small hopes we hold close to our hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, I share my real emotions, situations I faced, and the lessons life taught me — not as advice,
        but as truth. If even one person feels understood, this space has meaning.
      </p>

      <h2>For You Who Is Reading This</h2>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          "If you are tired, pause — not quit. If you are hurting, speak — not suffer silently.
          Even in the darkest night, morning is quietly preparing itself."
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Life Expectations</h2>
      <p>
        I don’t expect perfection from life. I expect honesty, small joys, healing over time,
        and people who try — even when they fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these words, I hope to remind you that your expectations matter,
        and your existence itself is enough.

      <h2>Why I Write</h2>
      <p>
        I write because some feelings cannot be spoken out loud.
        I write because there were days I wished someone would ask,
        <em>“Maama ani pilusta… neeku ela undi?”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not a writer by profession. I am just a human being who felt deeply,
        broke silently, healed slowly, and learned that sharing pain can become
        someone else’s hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ఇది నా కథ మాత్రమే కాదు.</strong><br/>
        <em>Idhi naa okkari katha kaadu.</em> This is for anyone who feels unheard.

      <h2>Daily / Weekly Reflections</h2>
      <p><strong>How this space works:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Today I Felt:</strong> A short honest emotion</li>
        <li><strong>What Life Showed Me:</strong> A situation or lesson</li>
        <li><strong>One Gentle Hope:</strong> Something to hold on to</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong><br/>
          Today I felt tired, but not defeated.<br/>
          Life showed me that waiting is also a form of courage.<br/>
          One gentle hope — <em>Na repu inkonchem better undochu.</em>
